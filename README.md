# (IBM-DOCASSIST) AI Assistant for Internal Docs (RAG + LLM + Docker)

A fully containerized, production-style **AI assistant** that helps users query internal documents (PDFs, DOCX, etc.) using **natural language**. Built with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, this system uses a vector database for semantic search and an LLM for answering questions contextually.

This project is ideal for enterprise environments (e.g. IBM, internal tools) where access to information across documents is crucial and must be deployed reliably via Docker.

---

## Features

- Upload internal documents (e.g. manuals, HR policies, research papers)
- Chunk + embed text into a vector DB
- Ask natural language questions
- AI responds with factual, human-like answers using LLM
- Fully containerized with Docker + orchestrated services
